# Linear Regression Lecture and Practical

This repository hosts the short-course developed by Dominic Waithe teaching Linear Regression. The content was designed to teach CGAT fellows (https://github.com/cgat-developers) who learn methods in bioinformatics. The course is Python3 based and teaches scikit-learn as well as pandas and a few other libraries.

The lecture content is available here:
